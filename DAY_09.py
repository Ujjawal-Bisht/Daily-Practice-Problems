Question 18: A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users. Following are the criteria for checking the password:

At least 1 letter between [a-z]
At least 1 number between [0-9]
At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
At least 1 character from [$#@]
Minimum length of transaction password: 6
Maximum length of transaction password: 12 Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma. Example If the following passwords are given as input to the program: ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345 Then, the output of the program should be: ABd1234@1

Question 19: You are required to write a program to sort the (name, age, height) tuples by ascending order where name is string, age and height are numbers. The tuples are input by console. The sort criteria is: 1: Sort based on name; 2: Then sort based on age; 3: Then sort by score. The priority is that name > age > score. If the following tuples are given as input to the program: Tom,19,80 John,20,90 Jony,17,91 Jony,17,93 Json,21,85 Then, the output of the program should be: [('John', '20', '90'), ('Jony', '17', '91'), ('Jony', '17', '93'), ('Json', '21', '85'), ('Tom', '19', '80')]
